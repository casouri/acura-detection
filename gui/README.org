Currently main files are =model.py= and =background.py=.

Run 
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
python3 model.py
#+END_SRC
to process video.

In =model.py= there is a iterator =VideoProcessor=. 
I each iteration it processes a frame from video.

Processing function is from =background.py= (currently only background subtraction)
Function =subtract= is the algorithm.
