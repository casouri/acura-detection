1. try library functions:
  MOG,GOG,etc
  Result: bad, too many noises and Aly's body is missing.

2. try subtracting. 
  Result: bad, Aly's body are not missing as much 
but there are too much noise, shadows connected.

3. try subtracting with channels separated
and combine afterward. Maybe that will eliminate
the problem of green color?
Result: better, but still noise, shadow.

4. try to use dilation and erosion to connect
Aly's body together and remove noise.
  Result: noises are still hard to remove,
also because I use too much erison & dilation,
edge is not smooth. And shadow is connected from time to time.

5. try to use last frame as background
  Result: no noise and clear edge,
but if you stand still you will be gone.

6. try to "mask" the last frame onto background
by a small factor (0.001)
  Result: still if you stand still for more than a few second,
you are gone.

7. try LAB color space.
L channel is really clear.
Threshold both way: pixels under a threshold and
pixels above a threshold are both removed.
Because I found many noises I cannot remove has
super high value -- higher than my target.
Result: less noise, although there are holes on target,
there are not many so it's ok. Also shadows are gone.
